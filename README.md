# Machine-Learning-Mini-project

I took the Assignment of IIT Delhi COL-774 course taught by prof. Parag Singla and Implemented all the four algorithms from the scratch in python, without using any already implemented library for these algorithms. I just used standard library of python,i.e. Numpy, pandas and matplotlib. 
Train the model on some sample data sets and produced an accuracy of around 90%.
Plotted the model on the graph using matplotlib against the data set taken by me.
